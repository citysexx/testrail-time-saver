# About 
This is a mini-life simplifier for QA specialists.

## Motivation
I got pissed off by the fact that as soon as the new build comes out, you gotta manually set your tests to retest. 
In big commercial projects this can take 1-2 hours just clicking. This is not my cup of tea so I made this script that automatizes monotous work for you.

## Features
- Set all tests in the selected project and test plan to `RETEST`
- feel free to contribute more, I will accept merge requests (pull requests) from you

## Support
This script works on Linux. For Windows, manual tweaks will be needed.

## Dependencies
- `python3` (3.9 or higher)
- `python-venv` package for linux. Please follow your distribution rules to install this package.
Tested on Ubuntu and Arch Linux.
Arch: `pacman -S python3-venv`
Ubuntu: `apt install python3-venv` 

## Usage
- clone this repository
- `chmod +x start.sh`
- launch `start.sh` without sudo privileges, enter your credentials and good to go!
